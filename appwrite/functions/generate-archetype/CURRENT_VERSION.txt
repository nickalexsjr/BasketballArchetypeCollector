Currently deployed: v3

v3 is the stable version currently in use on Appwrite.
v4 adds pre-warm endpoint but parallel generation didn't help
(ModelsLab processes images sequentially per API key anyway).

To deploy: Upload generate-archetype-v3.tar.gz (or the v4 one - same functionality,
just has extra warmup endpoint that returns immediately if warmup=true)
